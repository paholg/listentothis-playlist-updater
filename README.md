# r/listentothis Spotify playlist updater

This is just a simple tool to scrape hot of r/listentothis and to update a Spotify playlist with the
contents.

You can expect the playlist to be updated roughly once per day, and can find it here:
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0QLH8AqDfjGmcWK1vnf2sI

It does a pretty rough job searching Spotify, so expect it to miss tracks. Expect the playlist to
contain roughly 70 of the top 100 posts on r/listentothis.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, or requests, please file an issue or open a PR!
